# ü§ó Hugging Face Repository Protection Guide

## üìã Overview

Hugging Face repositories have different protection mechanisms than GitHub. This guide shows how to implement protection for your algorithmic trading repositories on Hugging Face.

## üõ°Ô∏è Available Protection Methods

### **1. Repository Settings (Web Interface)**

#### **Access Control:**
1. Go to your repository: `https://huggingface.co/ParallelLLC/algorithmic_trading`
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Configure these settings:

**Repository Visibility:**
- [x] **Private** (recommended for trading systems)
- [ ] Public (if you want to share)

**Collaboration:**
- [x] **Require approval for new collaborators**
- [x] **Restrict push access to maintainers only**

**Model Card:**
- [x] **Require model card for uploads**
- [x] **Validate model card format**

### **2. Git Hooks (Local Protection)**

#### **Pre-commit Hook:**
The pre-commit hook I created will:
- ‚úÖ Warn about direct commits to main
- ‚úÖ Run tests before commit
- ‚úÖ Check code formatting
- ‚úÖ Scan for secrets
- ‚úÖ Prevent commits if checks fail

#### **Install the Hook:**
```bash
# The hook is already installed in .git/hooks/pre-commit
# It will run automatically on every commit
```

### **3. CI/CD Protection**

#### **GitHub Actions (Recommended):**
Since Hugging Face integrates with GitHub:
1. **Keep GitHub as primary** with full protection
2. **Sync to Hugging Face** after GitHub validation
3. **Use GitHub's branch protection** rules

#### **Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Develop on GitHub (with protection)
git push origin feature/new-strategy

# 2. Create PR on GitHub
# 3. All checks pass
# 4. Merge to main
# 5. Sync to Hugging Face
git push hf main
git push esalguero_hf main
```

### **4. Manual Protection Practices**

#### **Development Workflow:**
```bash
# Always use feature branches
git checkout -b feature/new-strategy
# Make changes
git commit -m "feat: add new strategy"
git push origin feature/new-strategy

# Create PR on GitHub (not Hugging Face)
# Get reviews and approvals
# Merge on GitHub
# Then sync to Hugging Face
```

#### **Code Review Process:**
1. **Never commit directly to main**
2. **Always create feature branches**
3. **Use GitHub for PRs and reviews**
4. **Sync to Hugging Face after approval**

## üîß Implementation Steps

### **Step 1: Configure Repository Settings**
1. Go to: `https://huggingface.co/ParallelLLC/algorithmic_trading/settings`
2. Set repository to **Private**
3. Enable **Require approval for collaborators**

### **Step 2: Use GitHub as Primary**
1. **Develop on GitHub** with full protection
2. **Use GitHub's branch protection** rules
3. **Sync to Hugging Face** after validation

### **Step 3: Enable Pre-commit Hook**
```bash
# The hook is already installed and executable
# It will run automatically on commits
```

### **Step 4: Team Guidelines**
```markdown
## Development Guidelines for Hugging Face Repos

### ‚úÖ Do:
- Use GitHub for development and PRs
- Create feature branches for all changes
- Get code review before merging
- Run tests locally before pushing
- Sync to Hugging Face after GitHub approval

### ‚ùå Don't:
- Commit directly to main branch
- Push untested code
- Skip code review process
- Use Hugging Face for development workflow
```

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### **If Direct Commit to Main is Needed:**
```bash
# 1. Create emergency branch
git checkout -b hotfix/emergency-fix

# 2. Make minimal fix
git commit -m "hotfix: emergency fix for critical issue"

# 3. Test thoroughly
python -m pytest tests/
python demo.py

# 4. Push to GitHub first
git push origin hotfix/emergency-fix

# 5. Create emergency PR
# 6. Get expedited review
# 7. Merge and sync to Hugging Face
```

## üìä Protection Summary

### **GitHub (Primary Development):**
- ‚úÖ Full branch protection
- ‚úÖ Required reviews
- ‚úÖ CI/CD checks
- ‚úÖ Code owner reviews
- ‚úÖ Automated testing

### **Hugging Face (Distribution):**
- ‚úÖ Private repository
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks
- ‚úÖ Manual review process
- ‚úÖ Sync after GitHub validation

## üéØ Best Practices

### **1. Use GitHub as Source of Truth**
- All development happens on GitHub
- Hugging Face is for distribution
- Sync after GitHub validation

### **2. Never Skip Protection**
- Always use feature branches
- Always get code review
- Always run tests
- Always validate on GitHub first

### **3. Monitor Both Repositories**
- Check GitHub for development status
- Check Hugging Face for distribution status
- Ensure both are in sync
